# Understanding Deep Generative Models with Generalized Empirical Likelihoods

This repository includes an implementation of the generalized empirical
likelihood metric proposed in:
S. Ravuri, M. Rey, S. Mohamed, M. Deisenroth, "Understanding Deep Generative
Models with Generalized Empirical Likelihoods." Computer Vision and Pattern
Recognition, 2023.

The metric is implemented in the "Generalized_Empirical_Likelihood" colab.
The colab also includes some sample use cases, which you can find here: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/understanding_deep_generative_models_with_generalized_empirical_likelihood/blob/main/Generalized_Empirical_Likelihood.ipynb)
